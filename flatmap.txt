There are primitive variants of map methods mapToInt, mapToDouble and
 mapToLong that we will see later.
 Stream interface has method flatMap which returns a stream
  consisting of the results of replacing each element of this stream with the
   contents of a mapped stream produced by applying the provided mapping function to
each element.
 Sometime each element of a stream will produce individual streams
  that will be amalgamated into single stream and flatMap will be used there.
It might be confusing you now so let see an example where you need to
 find distinct words contained in a file. Here we will use File.lines() which will
  return Stream<String> where each element will represent to a single line of the file.
